# Woosmap Geofencing
Woosmap Geofencing helps you build Rich Push Notifications highlighted with a *Location context*, for iOS and Android.

* Notification Service with Location and API calls : [iOS](/iOS/LocationNotification) / [Android](/Android/LocationNotification)
* Get the user geolocation when receiving a Notification to complete the payload with information from Woosmap APIs. In this sample, we call the Woosmap Search API to get the closest POIs from the user's geolocation and display a Google Static Map of the POI's extent.
